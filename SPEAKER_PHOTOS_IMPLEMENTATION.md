# Speaker Photos Width Implementation

## Summary

This document describes the implementation of consistent 200px width for speaker photos on the website.

## Problem

The speaker photos were appearing smaller than intended due to the global CSS rule `img { max-width: 100%; }` which made images responsive and potentially smaller than the inline `width="200px"` attribute on smaller screens.

## Solution

### 1. CSS Implementation

Added specific CSS rules in `/workspace/assets/css/custom.css`:

```css
/* Speaker photos styling */
.speakers-table img {
  width: 200px !important;
  min-width: 200px;
  max-width: 200px;
  height: auto;
}

/* Responsive behavior for very small screens */
@media (max-width: 300px) {
  .speakers-table img {
    width: 180px !important;
    min-width: 180px;
    max-width: 180px;
  }
}
```

**Key Features:**
- Uses `!important` to override the global `max-width: 100%` rule
- Sets `width`, `min-width`, and `max-width` to ensure consistent sizing
- Includes responsive breakpoint for very small screens (under 300px) where 200px might cause horizontal scrolling
- Maintains aspect ratio with `height: auto`

### 2. HTML Structure Update

Modified `/workspace/speakers.md` to add the CSS class:

```html
<table class="speakers-table" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; width: 90%;border-collapse: collapse;">
```

This allows the CSS rules to target speaker images specifically without affecting other images on the site.

### 3. Testing Implementation

Created two test files:

#### A. Visual Test File (`test_speakers.html`)
- Simulates different viewport sizes
- Shows speaker photos at various screen widths
- Includes comparison with and without the CSS class
- Provides manual testing instructions

#### B. Validation Script (`validate_speakers.py`)
- Programmatically checks that CSS rules are present
- Validates HTML structure changes
- Ensures test files are created correctly
- Provides automated verification of the implementation

## Files Modified

1. **`/workspace/assets/css/custom.css`** - Added speaker-specific CSS rules
2. **`/workspace/speakers.md`** - Added `speakers-table` CSS class to the table

## Files Created

1. **`/workspace/test_speakers.html`** - Visual testing page
2. **`/workspace/validate_speakers.py`** - Automated validation script
3. **`/workspace/SPEAKER_PHOTOS_IMPLEMENTATION.md`** - This documentation

## Expected Behavior

### Desktop and Tablet (300px+ width)
- Speaker photos display at exactly **200px width**
- Images maintain aspect ratio
- No horizontal scrolling

### Small Mobile (under 300px width)
- Speaker photos display at **180px width** (responsive breakpoint)
- Prevents horizontal scrolling on very small screens
- Maintains readability and usability

### Other Images
- Unaffected by these changes
- Continue to use responsive behavior from global CSS rules

## Testing Instructions

### Manual Testing

1. **Build the Jekyll site locally:**
   ```bash
   bundle exec jekyll serve
   ```

2. **Open the speakers page:**
   - Navigate to `/speakers/` on the local site
   - Use browser developer tools to inspect image elements
   - Verify computed width is 200px (or 180px on small screens)

3. **Test responsive behavior:**
   - Use browser responsive design mode
   - Test various screen sizes
   - Ensure no horizontal scrolling occurs

4. **Use the test page:**
   - Open `/test_speakers.html` in the browser
   - Compare different viewport simulations
   - Verify expected behavior matches actual results

### Automated Validation

Run the validation script:
```bash
python3 validate_speakers.py
```

This will check:
- ✓ CSS rules are present and correctly formatted
- ✓ HTML structure includes the required CSS class
- ✓ All speaker images have the width attribute
- ✓ Test files are created and structured correctly

## Browser Compatibility

The implementation uses standard CSS features that are supported by all modern browsers:
- CSS `!important` declarations
- Media queries
- CSS class selectors
- Standard width/min-width/max-width properties

## Maintenance Notes

- The `speakers-table` CSS class can be reused for other speaker tables if needed
- The 300px breakpoint can be adjusted if different responsive behavior is desired
- Additional breakpoints can be added for tablet-specific sizing if needed
- The CSS rules are isolated and won't affect other site images
